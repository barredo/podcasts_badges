# Podcats Badgets

Podcasts icons created in the style of the Apple Podcasts new badge. The original, made by Apple is over here: https://www.apple.com/itunes/marketing-on-podcasts/identity-guidelines.html

I just made these super quick with Sketch. The files are in 1x, 2x and 3x. You can use them like this:

```
<img src="image.png"/> 
```
Prints just the file

```
<img src="image.png" srcset="image@2x.png 2x, image@3x.png 3x"/>
```
Prints the image.png file but the browser can chosee @2x or the @3x version if the system calls for them at the same size, but with more resolution.
